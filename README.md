# Lomuto-Hoare-Analysis

A Java application that takes different partitions (mainly from Hoare and Lomuto) and times them to see which partition is more efficient. 

The results were extremely close, but there was no official winner. We found out that the timing on these partitions depended on how the code was written and the hardware the user was using.
